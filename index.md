# Plain Vanilla GitHub Pages
The purpose of this project is to make it as easy as possible for low-tech people like me to create and host basic web pages for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## How it works
After creating your own copy of this template repository, add new pages as you need them using the markdown (.md) format. See the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) reference for how to add different elements to your pages. If you want to go beyond markdown and add more interactive elements (like button links for navigation components), you can copy and paste code snippets for [GitHub Primer components](https://primer.style/css/components) right into your pages.

<div class="my-6 text-center">
<a href="https://github.com/pglevy/plain-vanilla-gh-pages" class="btn-mktg btn-large-mktg">Get the template on GitHub</a>
</div>
